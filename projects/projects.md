# Projects
## Project Classification
Currently, the DeepModeling community divides projects into three different levels based on their maturity: mature projects, incubating projects, and sandbox projects. This approach ensures that developers understand their current position and provides a reference path for their long-term development. At the same time, it also helps community users to intuitively understand the current status of the projects. The following is an introduction to the different project levels:

**Mature projects**: This category is used to describe projects with a higher level of maturity within the community. These projects have already used the infrastructure tools provided by the community to operate, and they are supported by a wealth of use cases for users. 

Examples: DeePMD-kit,ABACUS

**Incubating projects**: This category is used to describe projects that can already be used as tools for community users. These projects have partially used the community's infrastructure tools to operate and have accumulated some use cases to support users. The maturity of these projects is lower than that of mature projects.

Examples: DeepFlame 

**Sandbox projects**: This category is used to describe early-stage projects. These projects may have only implemented their methods, and they currently lack the support of community infrastructure and are not widely usable by users.

Examples: DeePTB DMFF

When any project joins the community, its maturity status will be assessed, and corresponding labels will be provided for the project, publicly displaying the project level information within the community.

**Please note: We will continue to update the project classification system to make it increasingly in line with the requirements of community project development. Please stay tuned.**
## Project Stamping Mechanism
Projects joining the DeepModeling community are required to add a line to the project introduction in their README, indicating that the project is part of the DeepModeling community and providing a link to the community. An example is as follows:

XX(Project name) was created by XX(name of community or company) . The project joins the DeepModeling community, a community devote of AI for science, as an/a  (Sandbox ,Incubating or Mature) level project.
