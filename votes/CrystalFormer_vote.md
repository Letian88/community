# A Vote for New Projects:  CrystalFormer

## Proposal

_CrystalFormer_ is a transformer-based autoregressive model specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline materials. The space group symmetry significantly simplifies the
crystal space, which is crucial for data and compute efficient generative modeling of crystalline materials.

For more information, see the [original repository](https://github.com/zdcao121/CrystalFormer)

## Deadline

This vote is rather urgent as the corresponding paper is about to be published. Therefore, once all TOC members agree, we will pass it through voting.
