# A Vote for New Projects:  CrystalFormer

## Proposal

_CrystalFormer_ is a transformer-based autoregressive model specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline materials. The space group symmetry significantly simplifies the
crystal space, which is crucial for data and compute efficient generative modeling of crystalline materials.

For more information, see the [original repository](https://github.com/zdcao121/CrystalFormer)

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection.

## Scope

TOC MEMBERS.
