# A vote for new project: deepmodeling-projects

## Proposal

[This project](https://github.com/njzjz/deepmodeling-projects) tracks the metrics of all DeepModeling projects.
It is automatically generated from a [configuration file](https://github.com/njzjz/deepmodeling-projects/blob/main/projects.yaml) and can be automatically updated weekly.
It stores the history of the metrics so one can easily compare them in specific periods, which can used to show the public impact of a project or the DeepModeling community.

TOC members may need to check whether the [configuration file](https://github.com/njzjz/deepmodeling-projects/blob/main/projects.yaml) needs to be changed.
Also, a project can have a category and several tags which are not yet added.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection.

## Scope

TOC MEMBERS
