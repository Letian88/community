# A Vote for New Projects: GPUMD

## Proposal
 - GPUMD stands for Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics.
 - GPUMD is a highly efficient general-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) package fully implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs).
 - GPUMD enables training and using a class of machine-learned potentials (MLPs) called neuroevolution potentials (NEPs). See this [nep-data Gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/brucefan1983/nep-data) for some of the published NEP potentials and the related training/testing data.

For more information, see the [original repository](https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD)


## Deadline
The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection. Once all TOC members agree, we will pass it through voting.

## Scope
