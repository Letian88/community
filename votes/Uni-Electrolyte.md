# A Vote for New Projects Uni-Electrolyte

## Proposal

Electrolyte is one of the most important parts of rechargeable batteries, which mainly consists of organic molecules and lithium salt. 
Although many molecule machine learning models including Uni-Mol have been developed and have achieved great success in specific research fields, none of them can be directly applied to battery electrolyte. 
Uni-Electrolyte aims to fill the gap between molecule machine learning and electrolyte science study and will be the first universal machine learning model for electrolyte research. 

Name: Uni-Electrolyte
