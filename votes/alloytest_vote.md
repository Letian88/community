# A Vote for New Projects: alloytest

## Proposal


We propose to create a repository to host workflows (based on dflow) for property tests in alloys by using MD (LAMMPS) and DFT (ABACUS, VASP, ...).

For the name of this repository, other possible candidates are alloytester, alloyflow, and alloyflux. We currently use the name "alloytest" and we look forward to your comments.


## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 3 days unless there is an objection.（We change the vote time because a website for this repo is very urgent and this repo will benefit many users in the short-long terms.)

## Scope

TOC MEMBERS.
