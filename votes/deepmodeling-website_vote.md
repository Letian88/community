# A Vote for New DeepModeling Official Website

## Proposal
As the DeepModeling community continues to grow, we need a community official website with more abundant content and more flexible configuration to host more projects.

In order to achieve this goal, the community has recently developed a new official website and plans to replace the current content of the official website after this vote is passed. The updates of this official website include the following aspects:
- Overall beautification of the official website page.
- Adding the community project Landscape.
- The information of community projects is fetched from github, and the official website is more closely linked with github, showing more projects in the community.
- Constructing the back - end for official website administrators, which can flexibly adjust the projects displayed on the official website.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection.

## Scope

TOC MEMBERS.
